<h1>Learning Football</h1>
<h2>Styles</h2>
<p>The game that might change your life. It has tons new styles that you'll love! To get the website I used click <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">here.</a> The graphics might be cheesy but it is a good game to test your typing skills and gaming skills.</p>
<h2>The Point of the Game</h2>
<p>The point of the game is to score a goal on a penalty kick. If your kid is a football/soccer  guy/girl this is the game for him/her. It will help your child to like math. What kind of math you say? The 13 times table. Your child will slowly get better grades and slowly get him/her to a IV league college. The child will feel like Ronaldo and like math. Have FUN!!!</p>
<h2>The Learning</h2>
<p>Your kid will think he/she is playing an everyday game but he/she will not know that it is making him/her smarter. My game will make your child learn about math. It also lets the kid have FUN! Which is the most important thing! It will make your kid like school and want to learn more!
